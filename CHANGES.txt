0.9.4 Added For loops and Parallel sections
------------------------------------------------------------------
17-February-2010

 * Added support for basic For loops (though needs improvement)
 * Added support for running steps in Parallel.
 * Documentation updates
 * Added support for python 2.5 (stop using shlex.split with posix argument, 
   use Thread.isAlive() rather than Thread.is_alive() ).


0.9.3 Path handling, documentation, shell references
------------------------------------------------------------------
10-February-2010

 * Tabs characters are ignored (replaced before passing to YAML parser)
 * All steps are forced to be strings (makes it easier to use - "app with spaces" arg1 arg2 which could otherwise gives errors)
 * Documentation updates
 * Shell variables are available as <shell.varname> rather than just <varname> e.g. <shell.computername> (otherwise there is a risk of an environment variable 'left over' from other script affect a BetterBatch script.
 * Reduce some of the verbosity in default output (variables are not output to the log file, all references of a missing variable are not output unless you use -v/--verbose option)

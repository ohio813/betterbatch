0.9.8 Bug fixes, Improve parallelization (and add loop parallelization)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
30-March-2011
 
 * Allow parallel steps to include any steps (not just commands, echo steps)
 * Also add a qualifer to for loops to allow all the steps to be run in 
   parallel. This feature should be considered experimental. And is probably 
   not very useful unless used with functions or some other way of ensuring
   certain commands are not executed out of order. It may also mess up with 
   logging - but not validated yet.
 * Make the loop check time larger (previously it was too small which was
   causing a lot of CPU overhead - 'busy loop')
 * Split built in command was not working correctly - each item needed to 
   be on a line of its own.
 * Make function name lookup case insensitive
 * Trailing commas in function definitions and function calls looked like an 
   empty parameter - fixed the code so that they are ignored.
 * Improved how missing variables are checked. It was saying that defined 
   variables that used an undefined variable were undefined, fixed so that 
   only really undefined variables are listed as undefined.
 * Echo used to be implemented using the underlying DOS command - replaced
   with an EchoStep - which can handle multiline strings.
 * Include files now have the correct values for __script_filename__ and 
   __script_dir__ (they have the value of the included file - not the including
   file)
 * "Script Error!" is written as the last message if there was an error 
   encountered during execution, otherwise it may not be easy to spot at a 
   glance that there was indeed an error.
 * Small tool added to get the short path file/directory name on windows.
 * Improve some error messages


0.9.7 Functions, negative conditions, Setup/Installer and test fixes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
07-March-2011
 
 * Add preliminary support for Functions, give it a try and let me know.
 * Add support for negative conditions for IfSteps.  (e.g. if not exists, 
   if not defined, etc)
 * Add a supported qualifier to VariableDefinition Steps to allow delayed
   resolution for Variable references.
 * Allow defined to use <var_name> as well as var_name. (usability)
 * Due to a case issues (tools/Tools) the betterbatch\tools folder
   was left out of the distribution. There was also a bug that
   meant when this folder wasn't found BetterBatch would not run. (fixed in 0.9.6b)
 * Fix the old tests (change what could be changed and comment
   out the rest)
 * Change setup.py so that Setuptools will be used if it is 
   available - otherwise docutils. (fixed in 0.9.6b)
 * Add a -t/--timed option to print how long the script took
   to execute.
 * Fix manifest.in to include/exclude more files. (fixed in 0.9.6b)
 * Cleaned up the the output messages of PathExists(), PathNotExists() and 
   VerifyFileCount()
 * Ensured that the Testing phase is more silent (some messages that should 
   only be displayed during execution phase were being logged)
 * Some other small fixes.
 * Many thanks to Yuhui for pointing out many of these issues on the 
   mail list.


0.9.6 Fixed Some critical issues with variable references
------------------------------------------------------------------------
02-March-2011
 
 * Fixed an issue with how variables are dealt with. I was finding that during
   the run phase variables would still have values laeft over from the test 
   phase.


0.9.5 Added For loops and Parallel sections
------------------------------------------------------------------------
01-March-2011
 
 * Huge refactoring of the code. Removed Step.replace_vars() methods and 
   instead added a 'phase' parameter to execute. This makes the code simpler
   and reduces some duplication. Testing is now done by using 
   ``step.exectute(..., phase = "test")`` and execution by using 
   ``step.exectute(..., phase = "run")``.
 * Escape < and > in the output of commands.
 * Add many new tests overall coverage now 95%.
 * Added debug option (prints tracebacks on error).
 * Fixed `issue 1 <http://code.google.com/p/betterbatch/issues/detail?id=1>`_
   

0.9.4 Added For loops and Parallel sections
------------------------------------------------------------------------
17-February-2010

 * Added support for basic For loops (though needs improvement)
 * Added support for running steps in Parallel.
 * Documentation updates
 * Added support for python 2.5 (stop using shlex.split with posix argument, 
   use Thread.isAlive() rather than Thread.is_alive() ).


0.9.3 Path handling, documentation, shell references
------------------------------------------------------------------------
10-February-2010

 * Tabs characters are ignored (replaced before passing to YAML parser)
 * All steps are forced to be strings (makes it easier to use - "app with spaces" arg1 arg2 which could otherwise gives errors)
 * Documentation updates
 * Shell variables are available as <shell.varname> rather than just <varname> e.g. <shell.computername> (otherwise there is a risk of an environment variable 'left over' from other script affect a BetterBatch script.
 * Reduce some of the verbosity in default output (variables are not output to the log file, all references of a missing variable are not output unless you use -v/--verbose option)
